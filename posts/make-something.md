Today, I just wanted to make *something*, so I made this thing (fun with sound on):

It's pretty squished together. There are some circles, they change color when you hover over them, they play a randomly selected sound from an array when you click on them, and the box to the right also changes to a random gradient. I'd like more sounds, and I'd like for the buttons, the sounds, and the gradients to all relate to one another in a more defined, logical way. Right now they all just sort of do stuff at the same time, which is cool, but I want to dig deeper. 

Ironically, I got so deep into this project that I lost track of time and missed the creative coding club that met today. But I suppose I was there in practice.

I read about Hotwire earlier this morning, too, and I want to talk with Dave about it. HTML!
